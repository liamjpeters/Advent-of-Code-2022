# Your handheld device indicates that the distress signal is coming from a beacon nearby. The 
# distress beacon is not detected by any sensor, but the distress beacon must have x and y 
# coordinates each no lower than 0 and no larger than 4000000.

# To isolate the distress beacon's signal, you need to determine its tuning frequency, which can be 
# found by multiplying its x coordinate by 4000000 and then adding its y coordinate.

# In the example above, the search space is smaller: instead, the x and y coordinates can each be at
# most 20. With this reduced search area, there is only a single position that could have a beacon: 
# x=14, y=11. The tuning frequency for this distress beacon is 56000011.

# Find the only possible position for the distress beacon. What is its tuning frequency?
